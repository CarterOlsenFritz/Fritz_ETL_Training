# Fritz_Learning_Python
Well this repo is for CarterOlsenFritz to learn some Python.

# Self Goals
1. API Calls and scheduled, recurring uploads to SQL Server.
- Learn enough python to make pulling over APIs something I can do myself.
- Then go the next step into scheduling API calls then pushing the data daily (even hourly in the future) into Azure SQL. I'll probably just piggyback off the work server while I do this.
	- This may require some forays into cron (Linux), Task Scheduler (Windows), or launchd (Mac) (or some other scheduling software) to make each pull repeatable.

2. Version Control Basics
- I used bitbucket in the past to push and pull to/from development and production servers.
- Using Github here and incorporating Stephen so we can both learn the basics and not be worthless in the eyes of other people with mythical "hard skills".

# Bonus Goals
1. Web Scraping
2. Some other nerd shit.
3. Anything cool I can find utilizing Python to do home automation or something?
